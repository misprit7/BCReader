# Business Card Reader

This is a companion app to my [PCB business card project](https://github.com/misprit7/PCB-Business-Card). Mostly I wanted to try making an app with react native (and learn React itself at the same time), and figured this would be a good project to get started. 

It communicates with bluetooth with the NINA B306 chip I used for the PCB (same as Arduino Nano BLE 33) and can read I2C, UART as well as analyze analog and digital I/O.
